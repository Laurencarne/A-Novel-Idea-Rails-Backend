This is our Module Four React frontend and Rails backend app.
It is an online bookshop for those of us who love to read but never find the time to get to the shops!

* The home page contains an image slider that is linked to other pages on the site.

* You can look through different genres of books.

* Each book links to its own routed page with more information about that book.

* Add a book to your wishlist or cart.
